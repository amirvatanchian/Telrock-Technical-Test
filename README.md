Every now and then we are encountring new terms and concepts in the field of IT . One of the newest and hottest one is DevOps.
DevOps can be defined as a combinition of cultural concepts and tools that accelerates an organization's pace .
It increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at higher speed using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.
In the other word DevOps (development and operations) is a term used to mean a type of agile relationship between development and IT operations. The goal of DevOps is to merge these two teams into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations .
Under a DevOps model ,developers and operations teams collaborate closely, share many responsibilities, and combine their workflows. This reduces inefficiencies and saves time .
Generally speaking the concept of DevOps is twisted with Automation .
Not only DevOps refers to automating software development (CI/CD pipelines) ,but it also entails Infrastructure Automation (Infrastructure as Code ).
Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) are practices that automate the software release process, from development to deployment.
It increase the frequency and pace of releases so you can improve your product faster. The quicker you can release new features and fix bugs, the faster you can respond to your customers’ needs and build competitive advantage .

Infrastucture Automation (Infrastructure as code) is a practice in which infrastructure is provisioned and managed using code and software tools.
It enables developers and system administrators to interact with infrastructure programmatically, and at scale, instead of needing to manually set up and configure resources. 
So engineers can interface with infrastructure using code-based tools and treat infrastructure in a manner similar to how they treat application code. 
Because they are defined by code, infrastructure and servers can quickly be deployed or updated with the latest patches and versions.
Automation help you manage complex or changing systems efficiently and with reduced risk.

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a term which was created by Google around 2003 .
While some believe that Site reliability engineering is a seperate concept from DevOps , it is mostly agreed that SRE is a subfield of DevOps .because DevOps is a very general term that covers all things related to software delivery.
Site reliability engineering seeks to improve the reliability of currently operating software, while minimizing the work involved in its upkeep. operations teams mostly achieve this by automating as many tasks as possible .
Both SRE and DevOps are methodologies addressing an organization's needs for production operation management. 
But there are some differences : While DevOps raise problems and dispatch them to Dev to solve, the SRE approach is to find problems and solve some of them themselves.

DevOps Tools :
These are some of the most famouse DevOps tools 
Puppet : Server automation framework and application
Chef :  A systems integration framework, built to bring the benefits of configuration management to your entire infrastructure.
Ansible : Ansible is a simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy.
Salt : Software to automate the management and configuration of any infrastructure or application at scale.
Openstack : Repository containing OpenStack repositories .
Vagrant : Vagrant is a tool for building and distributing development environments.
Docker : A tool to provide lightweight, portable, flexible development environments.

As its mentioned before , DevOps is a general term including cultures , concepets and tools .So the nature of DevOps make it almost impossible to choose one trend of it without being involved in the others .
For being successful in the field of DevOps ,the first and most important step would be to change your attitude toward solving problems . Despite to traditional methodologies which were common in IT companies , DevOps bring both development and operation teams on a table for solving problems and helping each other to acheive higher efficiency .
